For my blog, I aimed to create a high-performance, statically generated site without relying on a third-party CMS. The site uses **MDX-formatted** posts stored directly in a GitHub repository and is built with **TypeScript and GraphQL**-based queries.
The posts can be queried and listed based on categories, therefore the category page templates can be easily updated with new content.

- **Gatsby**: For performance and scalability, Gatsby generates static HTML pages, ensuring fast load times and strong SEO. Its plugin ecosystem allows seamless integration with various data sources.

- **ChakraUI**: This React UI library simplifies development with pre-designed, accessible components. It enables rapid prototyping while maintaining a consistent design.

- **Netlify**: For seamless deployment, Netlify automates builds from Git repository updates, eliminating manual steps.
