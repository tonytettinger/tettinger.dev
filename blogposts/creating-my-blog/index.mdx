I have created my homepage with the following tech stack: Gatsby framework (with GraphQL), GitHub, ChakraUI for styling, Netlify for deployment, GitHub, and MDX for managing content. 

The goal was to create an independent, portable, and flexible blogging framework. 

Gatsby allows me to use the JSX syntax while providing useful plugins for image optimization and SEO out of the box. The routing system and [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/) are convenient too. 

I'm technology-agnostic, but I have been focusing on JavaScript frameworks and libraries recently and I like the functional way of programming. 

I've selected Netlify because I would like to add serverless functions to the page in the future and it provides a fast and straightforward deployment process. 

I can see some merits in using ChakraUI as I am getting familiar with it. I am used to writing my CSS without additional layers of abstraction, but sometimes these tools could facilitate rapid prototyping, and I can see some clear benefits since it enforces some CSS best practices and simplifies certain elements. 

And why Gatsby? I wanted to try out this "blazingly fast" framework and figure out how it works. Overall it was a pleasant experience to build the site with this stack.
