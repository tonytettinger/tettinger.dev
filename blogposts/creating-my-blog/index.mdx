I have created this homepage/blog with the following tech stack:
Gatsby framework, GitHub, ChakraUI for styling, Netlify for deployment and MDX for editing content. 

The goal was to create an independent, portable and flexible blogging framework.

Gatsby allows me to use the JSX syntax, while providing useful plugins for image optimization and SEO out of the box.
The routing system and documentation is quite convenient.

I have been also testing GitHub Copilot recently, but I had to turn off the AI while writing this post, because it tries to write the whole thing by itself...

I'm technology-agnostic, although I have been focusing on JavaScript frameworks and libraries recently. I've selected Netlify because, I would like to add serverless functions to the page and it provides a fast and 
straightforward deployment process hooked up with GitHub. I can see some merits using ChakraUI as I am getting familiar with it, although I am used to writing my own CSS without an additional layer of abstraction. I can see some clear benefits, since its enforcing some best practices and simplifies certain tasks.

Regarding Gatsby: I wanted to try out this "blazing fast" framework, although I am not convinced by the build time, but overall it is a pleasant experience.
In a future post I will give some more feedback regarding my learnings from building this blog and about the process of making it.
