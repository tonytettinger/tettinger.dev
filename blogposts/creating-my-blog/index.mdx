I have created my homepage with the following tech stack:
Gatsby framework (with GraphQL), GitHub, ChakraUI for styling, Netlify for deployment, GitHub and MDX for managing content. 

The goal was to create an independent, portable and flexible blogging framework.
Gatsby allows me to use the JSX syntax, while providing useful plugins for image optimization and SEO out of the box.
The routing system and [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/) is quite convenient too.

I'm technology-agnostic, although I have been focusing on JavaScript frameworks and libraries recently. I've selected Netlify because I would like to add serverless functions to the page in the future and it provides a fast and 
straightforward deployment process. I can see some merits using ChakraUI as I am getting familiar with it, however I am used to writing my own CSS without additional layers of abstraction. Although I can see some clear benefits, since it enforces some CSS best practices and simplifies certain tasks.

And why Gatsby? I wanted to try out this "blazing fast" framework and figure out how it works. I am not convinced with the build time, but overall it is a pleasant experience.
In a future post I will give some more feedback regarding my learnings from building this site and will keep adding functionalities to it.
