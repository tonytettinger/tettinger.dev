This is long overdue. What have I been doing these times? 
Currently I'm learning about a wide range of concepts as a Full Stack Engineer MSc student at JAMK university.
My current interests are learning to use advanced TypeScript concepts in a React context.
learning about DevOps, development best practices and cloud technologies.
I have made some minor updates removing the like functionality, and since I really liked the font family in the
article [about memoization best pracies in React](https://attardi.org/why-we-memo-all-the-things/).
I have made a few mini-projects such as a [route planner demo that uses Canvas](https://app.netlify.com/sites/the-awesome-tonytettinger-site/overview)
in the meantime. I'm planning to use this space to keep my personal learnings in short form articles.
