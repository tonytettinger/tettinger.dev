This post is long overdue. What have I been doing these times? 
Since September I'm learning about a wide range of software engineering concepts as a Full Stack Engineer MSc student at [JAMK university](https://www.jamk.fi/en).
Besides that my current interests are learning to use advanced TypeScript concepts in a React context, DevOps, development best practices and cloud technologies.

I have made some minor updates on my web page such as removing the like functionality (no need for database dependency and not so many people visiting my page), and changing the font family since I really liked the one in the
article [about memoization best practices in React](https://attardi.org/why-we-memo-all-the-things/).

I have made a few mini-projects such as a [route planner demo that uses Canvas](https://app.netlify.com/sites/the-awesome-tonytettinger-site/overview)
in the meantime. I'm planning to use this space to keep my personal learnings in short form articles in a variety of topics.
