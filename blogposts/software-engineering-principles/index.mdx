Continuous learning is an absolute necessity.

Understanding requirements and coordinating with product owners, designers, engineers, and other stakeholders through open, concise, and efficient communication is crucial for delivering user value.

Modular code that is easy to modify makes projects robust, scalable and reduces the cognitive load on developers. This allows for adapting to changing business requirements.

Striking a balance between development speed and reliance on abstractions and third-party providers is essential. Focusing on the fundamentals behind technologies helps maintain this balance.

Being open to changing one's mind and not getting attached to solutions is a great way to avoid traps like the sunk cost fallacy.

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and YAGNI (You Arenâ€™t Gonna Need It). Keep an open mind, keep things simple, reduce complexity as much as possible and manage what remains.
