For my master's thesis project in Full Stack Software Development, I developed an application that calculates the present value of companies listed on the stock market. The app evaluates companies based on criteria such as daily percentage changes and uses a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to estimate their present value. If the current market value drops below the estimated value by a specified percentage, the application triggers webhooks to send an alert via a dedicated Slack channel and automatically deploys a summary, including visualizations with Chart.js. The application was self-hosted on a Raspberry Pi and aimed to demonstrate the rapid, iterative development of a minimum viable product (MVP).

Features:

- **Python Flask**: Rapid development of backend API and frontend templates, with a wide range of well-established helper libraries
- **Tailwind CSS**: Template styling
- **Chart.js**: Displayling charts quick and easy
- **SQLite**: Low-complexity, easy to setup self-hosted database
- **Netlify**: Webhook-based deployment
