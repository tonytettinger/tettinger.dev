As the founding engineer of the Product Growth Team at Xentral, I have been tasked with implementing a redesigned homepage that accurately represents the company's image and creates a strong, positive impression. We have worked iteratively with the UX and Product Team under a tight deadline to create a well-structured, maintainable page that gives editors the freedom to modify modular blocks and component styles directly from the CMS.

Features:

- **Typed GraphQL queries**: All the fetched data is full typed thanks to type generation integration.
- **Responsive Modular Design**: The sections of the pages has been broken down into reusable elements that can also be easily customized based on predefined UI patterns.
- **NextJS**: For fast iterations, clean architecture and performance.
- **Hygraph**: Headless CMS for efficient content management.
