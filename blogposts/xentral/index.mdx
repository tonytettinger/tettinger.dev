As the founding engineer of the Product Growth Team in Xentral, I have been tasked to implement a redesigned homepage that represents well the company image and creates an impression that the company deserves.
We have iteratively worked with the UX and Product Team with a tight deadline, creating a well structured, maintainable page that gives the editors freedom to modify the modular blocks and components styles directly from the CMS.

Features:

**Key Features**:

-   **Typed GraphQL queries**: All the fetched data is full typed thanks to type generation integration
-   **Responsive Modular Design**: The sections of the pages has been broken down into reusable elements that can also be easily customized based on predefined UI patterns.
-   **NextJS**: For fast iterations, clean architecture and performance
