I created this TypeScript-based Next.js app with ChakraUI as a fun project to quickly check the latest movie releases and their ratings whenever I'm running out of ideas for what to watch.

The data for this app is sourced from TMDB (The Movie Database), a trusted resource for movie information.

You can explore the app here:
Latest Movies App

Check out the GitHub repo here:
GitHub Repo - Latest Movies Project

Enjoy your movie-watching journey!
