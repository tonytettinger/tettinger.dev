https://latest-movie-releases.netlify.app/

This **TypeScript-based Next.js web app**, styled with a clean responsive design based on **ChakraUI**. It is a small app I built to quickly check the latest movie releases and their ratings whenever Iâ€™m running out of ideas for what to watch.  
The app fetches data from **The Movie Database (TMDB)** via a dedicated backend API endpoint, which is part of this application. It is **client-side rendered** to ensure users always have access to the most up-to-date information.
For improved performance and scalability, **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** could be implemented if hosted on Vercel, or periodic redeployments with server-side fetching could be used to refresh the data.

**Key Features**:

-   **Real-time Movie Data**: Fetches up-to-date movie information from TMDB.
-   **Responsive Design**: Built with ChakraUI for a consistent experience across devices.
-   **TypeScript**: For type safety and maintainable code.
