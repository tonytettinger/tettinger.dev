I have always been a fan of movies, being hooked from an early age. I have rented out all the VHS tapes and went to the cinema several times a week if there were new movies. 

Later on (especially during the pandemic peak times) we've binge watched all the movies with my wife from HBO Go, Netflix and so on. We got to the stage, where we ran out of movies to watch. 

It became increasingly tedious to find watchable movies. Our general rule of thumb is that if a movie is below a 5.5 rating on [imdb](https://imdb.com), then it isn't worth our time. On the other hand if it is getting close to 9 it might be something too deep, too abstract that we also don’t like usually. 

So the issue became finding new movies that are worth watching. I didn’t find a solution that I really enjoyed and had all the movies included. I’ve decided to create a custom NextJS based application for that, which displays the new movies released in the last 30 days with ratings included.  It’s based on NextJS, TypeScript, ChakraUI - again for rapid prototyping I found it useful - and the data is provided by [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

You could check out the live application here:
