I've always been a huge movie buff, and my love for films began at an early age. I used to rent out VHS tapes and head to the cinema multiple times a week just to catch the latest releases.

Fast forward to recent times, especially during the peak of the pandemic, my wife and I resorted to binge-watching movies on platforms like HBO Go and Netflix. We went through countless films, but eventually, we hit a roadblock. It became a real challenge to find movies that were worth our time. Our rule of thumb was simple: if a movie had a rating below 5.5 on IMDb, we'd skip it. On the other hand, if it was nearing a 9, it often ventured into deep, abstract territory that didn't quite align with our tastes.

So, we found ourselves in a bit of a pickle â€“ struggling to discover new movies that would actually be worth watching. I scoured the internet for a solution that would tick all the boxes, but nothing quite hit the mark. That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a custom application using NextJS as the foundation. With this app, I could showcase the latest movie releases from the past 30 days, complete with ratings. To speed up the development process, I turned to TypeScript and ChakraUI, which proved to be invaluable tools. The data I used for the app came from the reliable folks at TMDB (The Movie Database).

If you're curious, you can check out the live application right here:

Happy movie-watching!
